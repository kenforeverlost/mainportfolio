            I've lived in Nevada for most of my life and proudly call myself a
            Vegas local. While I've never flown in "for the weekend" like most
            visitors, I've had the privilege of watching the city evolve â€” from
            the ever-changing skyline to the growing tech scene.

            Professionally, I've built a variety of digital systems for both
            internal teams and external clients. I focus not just on writing
            clean code, but on creating solutions that are intuitive, efficient,
            and scalable. My work includes modernizing legacy applications,
            integrating APIs, designing engaging user experiences, and more.

            Outside of coding, my hobbies range from traveling and photography
            to video games and escape rooms. I also enjoy attending concerts,
            playing pickleball, and rock climbing. These activities inspire
            creativity and sharpen the problem-solving skills I bring to my
            work.
