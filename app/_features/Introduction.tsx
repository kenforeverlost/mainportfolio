            I've lived in Nevada for most of my life and proudly call myself a
            Vegas local. While I've never flown into the city "for the weekend"
            like most visitors, I've had the privilege of watching the city
            evolve â€” from the ever-changing skyline to the growing tech scene.

            Professionally, I've built a wide range of digital systems for both
            internal teams and external clients. I focus not just on writing
            clean code, but on creating solutions that are intuitive, efficient,
            and scalable. My work includes modernizing legacy applications,
            integrating APIs, designing engaging user experiences, and more.

          <Typography variant="body1">
            Outside of coding, I enjoy traveling, live music, video games, and
            photography. I also take part in physical activities like
            pickleball, rock climbing, and escape rooms. These hobbies inspire
            creativity and sharpen the problem-solving skills I bring to my
            work.
